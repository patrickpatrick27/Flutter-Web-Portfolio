Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! This website is built entirely using **Flutter Web** to demonstrate responsive design, custom animations, and clean architecture. It serves as a central hub for my academic, personal, and client projects.

## 🌟 About Me
I am a Senior Computer Engineering student at **Cavite State University**, based in Trece Martires, Philippines. I specialize in mobile application development and hardware-software integration. 

I have a **"Solutions-First"** mindset—I don't just write code; I build tools that fix real-world process inefficiencies, from payroll automation to IoT-based monitoring systems.
